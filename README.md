## Description
This is a Decimal, Binary and Hexadecimal Converter made with [Vuejs](https://v3.vuejs.org/).
It's a normal Converter, But with a Matrix rain animation in Background. 
The code is avaible on [GitHub](https://github.com/CapoStudios/bin2bin) and it's Open Source.
I Hope this little project helps new developers with Vuejs.
